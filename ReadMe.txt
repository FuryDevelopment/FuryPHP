Why did you scrap Irate Framework (IRFW)?
    - I decided to scrap the old framework because
      I now understand the concept behind a MVC based
      framework now, and have decided to recreate the
      framework that I know I can build.
      
What does FuryPHP bring that IRFW didn't?
    - This framework scraps the old "modulator" system
      and now runs off of a MVC (Model, View, Controller)
      system that automatically picks up on whether the
      Controller exists without the use of a database. 
      This optimized the load time by a large margin. This
      framework is also 100% OOP based code, which will allow
      for a "no running unless called upon" type system that
      also optimizes load time.
      
Does this framework run off of the smarty template system?
    - Yes, for now this framework runs off of the smarty
      template system, however, I can not gaurantee that
      will always be the case. If I find a way to optimize
      the load times without it, I will go to a custom
      template engine.
      
Features:
    - 100% OOP Based Code.
    - Faster Load times.
    - 100% MVC Based.
    - No database required.
